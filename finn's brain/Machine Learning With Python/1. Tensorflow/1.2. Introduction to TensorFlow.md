# Introduction to Tensorflow

### What is a tensor?
Tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions, is basically a data point. 
A vector can have any number of dimensions, 1d, 2d, 3d, etc.
Tensors are the main object on tensorflow, each tensor represents a partialy defined computation that will eventually produce a value  -- tensores são chamados também de pesos -- Each tensor has a data type and a shape, shapes will be explained soon.

-- copied -- 
```python

#Examples of how to create diferent kinds of tensors in tensorflow:

import tensorflow as tf

string = tf.Variable("this is a string example", tf.string)
number = tf.Variable(234, tf.int16)
floating = tf.Variable(3.456, tf.float64)


```

-- note -- 
Running 
```python
import tensorflow as tf

rank_tensor = tf.Variable([["test", "ok"], ["test", "yes"]], tf.string)

print(tf.rank(rank_tensor))
```
returns us:
```sh
# -- a bunch of warnings --
tf.Tensor(2, shape=(), dtype=int32)
```

Usually, variables like `floating = tf.Variable(3.456, tf.float64)` (that only registers one value) returns a vector with no dimensions, this kind of var definition basically isn't used.

When we have a var like `tf.Variable(["this is a string example"], tf.string)`, we get a rank of at least 1, when we have a list or array, thats because we can have at least one dimension, it's called "rank 1 tensor"
