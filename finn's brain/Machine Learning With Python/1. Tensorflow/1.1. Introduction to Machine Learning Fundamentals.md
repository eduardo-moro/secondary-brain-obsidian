### Difference between Artificial inteligence, Neural network and Machine learning

1. Artificial inteligence:
	- Artificial intelligence is the effort to automate intellectual tasks usually performed by humans;
	- In 50's there was a questioning coming from scientits: can computers think? Ai used to be a static predefinition of rules, no learning or AI alghorithms, they used to be lots of ifs and elses;
	- Ai goes from simple to complex tasks, even game enemies can be considered AIs, as they claim to  perform the task of persuing the player;
2. Machine Learning
	- Machine learning is a evolution of the preset rules from AIs, where the machine discovers and "learn" the rules and sets it to itself, the rules are not preset, they are set by the own machine when it figures it out;
	- 
	- Machine learning models not ever does what it is supposed to do, it only tries, and the rules can may be missunderstood;
3. Neural Networks or Deep Learning
	- Neural networks are a form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data;

>Neural networks has two layers:
	- Input layer
	- Output layer
	And we have the rules "Layer" that is the bridge between these two layers

Deep learning can have more than two layers, it can have more information being inputed in multiple layers, that are interpreted based on lower layers information. The data is going to be transformed while passing thru those layers. Some people call it "multi-stage information extraction process"

AI don't need a predefined set of layers.

#### Data

Data is the main resource for an AI, let's suppose we have a dataset of students that are doing a set of tests: Midterm 1, midterm 2 and Final:

\  | Midterm 1 | midterm 2 | final
-- | - |- |- 
1 | 70 | 80 | 77
2 | 60 | 90 | 84
3 |40 | 50 | 38

How can I predict the future results of these students in their tests based in this information?
lets suppose we have the midterm 1 and final grade from student n1, we need to feed an AI model with the information from this rows, the more data we get, the better
